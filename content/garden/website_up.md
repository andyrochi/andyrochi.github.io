I've always thought about having my own website—a personal space beyond social media—where I can share recent activities, projects, thoughts, notes, or anything else I feel like sharing.

So here it is, the first article on this website! I'm hopeful that I can motivate myself to update it regularly. The content here will be in either English or Chinese, depending on my mood and whichever language I feel more comfortable with at the moment. So... see you soon!
