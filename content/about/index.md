Hi, I'm Andy Chia-Hao Chang (張家豪). Welcome to my personal website, where I occasionally share random thoughts on *travelling*, *specialty coffee*, and *visual arts*.
<!-- 
I'm currently an intern at [Plume Design](https://www.plume.com/), developing  -->
I recently received my B.Sc. in Computer Science from [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU)](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/en/index) in Taiwan. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to work with Dr. [Yen-Yu Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/yylinweb/) on text-supervised semantic segmentation and vision-language models.

Aside academics, I have extensive experience in full-stack development, where I served as a lead developer for [SYNC, A crowdsourcing platform for news co-editing](https://sync.muilab.org/#/). I also had internship experiences at [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business.html) and [ITRI](https://www.itri.org.tw/english/), where I honed my skills on cloud and web technologies. For a full record of my experiences, please visit my LinkedIn profile.
