Hi, I'm Andy Chia-Hao Chang (張家豪). Welcome to my personal site, where I share my work and some random thoughts on things I find interesting.

I’m currently pursuing my master’s degree in Computer Science at [Cornell Tech (Cornell University)](https://www.tech.cornell.edu/). I recently earned my B.Sc. in Computer Science from [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU)](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/en/index) in Taiwan. During my undergraduate years, I had the privilege of working with Dr. [Yen-Yu Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/yylinweb/) on text-supervised semantic segmentation and vision-language models.

Outside of academics, I have extensive experience in software engineering and full-stack development. I was the lead developer for [SYNC, a crowdsourcing platform for news co-editing](https://sync.muilab.org/#/). Additionally, I gained valuable experience during internships at [Plume Design](https://www.plume.com/) and [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business.html), where I further honed my skills in software engineering and cloud technologies. For a complete overview of my experiences, feel free to visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andychchang).

I’m passionate about a wide range of topics beyond technology, including art, coffee, history, travel, and photography. My exchange program in Paris in 2023 deepened my appreciation for art and culture, and I’m excited to continue exploring these interests in New York City. Here, I aim to blend my passion for technology with my diverse range of interests.
