I’ve been fortunate to receive a rigorous and well-rounded computer science education through both research and coursework.

## Cornell Tech (New York City)
![cornell-tech-logo](cornell-tech-svg.svg)

**M.Eng. in Computer Science** — Specializing in deep learning and systems  
**Selected coursework:** Deep Learning, ML Engineering, ML Hardware and Systems, NLP, Computer Vision, HCI & Design, Virtual & Augmented Reality, Security and Privacy, Product Studio  
**Academic Awards:** Merit-based Scholarship  

At Cornell Tech, I’ve been focused on deepening my understanding of deep learning across multiple dimensions: from engineering frameworks and hardware systems to practical applications in language modeling and computer vision. Exploring the user-facing side of technology through the Studio curriculum and HCI courses has also been a valuable part of my experience.

## National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (Taiwan)
