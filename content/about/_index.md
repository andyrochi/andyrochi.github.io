## Hi all, I'm Andy! 👋

I'm Andy Chia-Hao Chang (張家豪), a New York-based software engineer who enjoys building reliable systems, meaningful applications, and intelligent products. I find inspiration in everything from coffee and code to culture and design.

I have a strong background in deep learning and systems, with a particular interest in the intersection of AI and human-centered design. I hold an M.Eng. in Computer Science from [Cornell Tech (Cornell University)](https://www.tech.cornell.edu/), where I specialized in deep learning and systems - from language modeling and computer vision to hardware-aware ML. Previously, I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Science from [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU)](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/en/index) in Taiwan, where I [conducted research](/projects/code) on vision-language models under Professor [Yen-Yu Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/yylinweb/).

My professional journey includes building scalable software and cloud-native applications. I was the lead developer for [SYNC, a crowdsourcing platform for news co-editing](https://sync.muilab.org/#/), and have gained experience through various software engineering roles at companies like [Plume Design](https://www.plume.com/), [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business.html), and [ITRI](https://www.itri.org.tw/english/). You can find a full overview of my experiences on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andychchang/).

You can also find more details on my selected coursework and research on my [Academic Experience →](/about/academic) page.



## Hobbies and Interests

I’m passionate about a wide range of topics beyond technology, including art, coffee, traveling, language learning, and photography. During my senior year, I participated in an exchange program in [Paris, France](https://www.isep.fr/) that broadened my perspective on global education and deepened my appreciation for art and culture. Now in New York City, I continue to explore and blend my passion for technology with my diverse interests.
