## Hi all, I'm Andy! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andy Chia-Hao Chang (å¼µå®¶è±ª), a New York-based tech enthusiast who enjoys building intelligent systems and finding inspiration in everything from coffee and code to culture and design.

Iâ€™m currently pursuing my masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at [Cornell Tech (Cornell University)](https://www.tech.cornell.edu/), specializing in deep learning and systems - from language modeling and computer vision to hardware-aware ML. Previously, I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Science from [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU)](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/en/index) in Taiwan, where I developed strong foundation in systems, networking, and multimedia, and [conducted research](/projects/code) on vision-language models under Professor [Yen-Yu Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/yylinweb/).

Beyond academics, Iâ€™ve built a range of practical experiences in software engineering and full-stack development. I was the lead developer for [SYNC, a crowdsourcing platform for news co-editing](https://sync.muilab.org/#/), and have interned at [Plume Design](https://www.plume.com/), [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business.html) and [ITRI](https://www.itri.org.tw/english/), where I honed my skills in building scalable software and cloud-native applications.

You can find more details on selected coursework and research on my [Academics â†’](/about/academic) page, or view a full overview of my experiences on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andychchang/).

## Hobbies and Interests

Iâ€™m passionate about a wide range of topics beyond technology, including art, coffee, traveling, language learning, and photography. During my senior year, I participated in an exchange program in [Paris, France](https://www.isep.fr/) that broadened my perspective on global education and deepened my appreciation for art and culture. Now in New York City, I continue to explore and blend my passion for technology with my diverse interests.
